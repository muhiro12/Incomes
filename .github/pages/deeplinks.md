# Incomes Deep Links

Use these links to trigger generic Incomes routes via Universal Links.

## Notes

- These links are generic and do not contain personal identifiers.
- On iOS/iPadOS with Incomes installed, the app should open.
- If the app is not installed, the browser opens the URL.

## Routes

- [Open Home](https://muhiro12.github.io/Incomes/v1/home)
- [Open Settings](https://muhiro12.github.io/Incomes/v1/settings)
- [Open Year 2026](https://muhiro12.github.io/Incomes/v1/year/2026)
- [Open February 2026](https://muhiro12.github.io/Incomes/v1/month/2026-02)
- [Open Search (rent)](https://muhiro12.github.io/Incomes/v1/search?q=rent)

## Optional direct paths

Some builds may also accept links without the `/Incomes` prefix:

- [Home (no prefix)](https://muhiro12.github.io/v1/home)
- [Settings (no prefix)](https://muhiro12.github.io/v1/settings)
